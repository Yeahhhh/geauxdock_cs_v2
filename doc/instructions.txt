=== Description
GeauxDock is an ultra-fast automated docking program, designed to predict
how small ligands bind to pharmacologically relevant macromolecules.

GeauxDock  employs a novel hybrid force field and a Monte Carlo protocol for 
the efficient sampling of conformational space.

The GPU codes use features that are supported since Kepler-Generation Graphics 
processing unit(GPU), and been tunned for Kepler GK110 and Maxwell 2.0 GPUs.

GeauxDock has applications in:
1. ligand virtual screening
2. structure-based drug design
3. drug repositioning and polypharmacology


=== Purpose
The purpose of molecular docking is to predict the preferred orientation of 
small ligands within the binding sites of pharmacologically relevant 
macromolecules as well as to reliably estimate the associated strength of 
binding. GeauxDock simulates small molecule binding to proteins expanding the 
repertoire of tools for computer-aided structure-based drug discovery.

=== Specifications 
Compared to other ligand docking programs, GeauxDock offers several unique 
features:

1. A mixed-resolution of protein-ligand complexes. Ligands are treated at the 
atomic level, whereas proteins are coarse-grained representing individual 
residues by sets of effective points: the backbone alpha carbon, the geometric 
center of a peptide plate, and either one or two effective points representing 
the side chain (depending on the size).

2. A high tolerance to target structure deformations. As a consequence of the 
mixed-resolution, GeauxDock is fairly insensitive to distortions in protein 
structures. Thus, experimental structures in their apo conformational states as 
well as various quality protein models can be used as targets for small 
molecule docking.

3. A combined evolution/physics-based force field. The energy function 
implemented in GeauxDock integrates evolution- and physics-based components. 
The relative contribution of these terms depends on the amount of evolutionary 
information extracted from homologous complexes. In the absence of homologues, 
weaker evolutionary-derived restraints are compensated by the stronger 
contribution of physics-based energy terms.The capability of the force field to 
reproduce experimental ligand binding poses and the corresponding binding 
affinities was tested on the Astex/CCDC and BindingDB datasets of 
pharmacologically relevant protein-ligand complexes.

4. Monte Carlo sampling scheme. GeauxDock uses the Replica Exchange Monte Carlo 
algorithm to efficiently explore the conformational space of protein-ligand 
interactions. This protocol was optimized to rapidly discover near-native 
ligand configurations.

4. Computations on graphics processing units (GPU). GeauxDock is implemented in 
CUDA-C. The code exploits the coarse-grained parallelisms for multiple 
replicas; specifically, replica simulations are dispatched on multiple CUDA 
thread blocks. The computation of molecular interactions utilizes the 
fine-grained parallelism using massive CUDA threads.
